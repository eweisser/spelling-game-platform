# spelling-game-platform
A simple platform game for studying spelling, in which students play as a letter looking for a word to fit into.

This program, written in Javascript, is intended to supplement book 2 of "STORIX", a Korean EFL book series for kindergarten-age students published by Yeamoonsa. It does not include any copyrighted material; it only incorporates the target vocabulary from these books.

In the game, players choose from a group of available letters to "play as". The player can then move around the screen with the mouse and click to jump (clouds can be jumped on and work as surfaces). Vocabulary words are found on clouds all around the stage; each word is missing one letter. The player must jump and move to the gap in the correct word. After doing so, a player can choose a different letter and try again, until all letters have been used.
